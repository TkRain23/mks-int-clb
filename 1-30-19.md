### Question #1:
> Part 1: Given an array of integers, return an array of integers such that the value at index i of the output is the product of everything in the input except the element at i

```Python
# input:
[1, 2, 3, 4]

# expected output:
[24, 12, 8, 6]

# explanation
[(2*3*4), (1*3*4), (1*2*4), (1*2*3)]

# edge case:
# what if the array contains zeroes?
# if you used division, can you do it without it?
# can it handle negative numbers?
[1, 2, 0, 4]
```

### Solution #1

### Question #2

> Implement a Stack with the following methods: push, pop, peek, is_empty, and max

```Python
# complete all of the functions

class Stack():
    def __init__():
        # TODO: tbd
        pass

    def push():
        # TODO: puts an item on top of the stack
        pass

    def pop():
        # TODO: removes an element from the top of the stack
        pass

    def peek():
        # TODO: return the top element of the stack
        pass

    def is_empty():
        # TODO: returns true if elements are in the stack, else, return false
        pass

    def max():
        # TODO: return the max value in the stack
        pass

```
